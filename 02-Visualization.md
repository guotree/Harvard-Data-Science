## 7. Visualizing data distributions
- **Variable types**: categorical (ordinal or not) and numeric (discrete or continuous)
	- discrete numeric data can be considered ordinal
- **Distributions**: 
	1. empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF)
	2. histograms
	3. smooth density plots: make it easier to compare two distributions
	4. normal distribution: use mean and standard deviation to describe the distribution.
- **Boxplots**: provides a five-number summary composed of the range (the minimum and maximum) along with the quartiles (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles)
-  **stratification**: Dividing observations into groups based on the values of one or more variables associated with those observations. 
	- the resulting groups is _strata_.
