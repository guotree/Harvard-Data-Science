# Inference and Modeling

## 1. Parameters and Estimates

**Parameters**: we define _parameters_ to represent unknown parts of our models.

## 4. Hypothesis testing

**p_value**: We have observed a random variable X¯=0.52, and the p-value is the answer to the question: How likely is it to see a value this large, when the null hypothesis is true? If the p-value is small enough, we _reject the null hypothesis_ and say that the results are _statistically significant_. (The p-value is the probability of observing a value as extreme or more extreme than the result given that the null hypothesis is true.)

**Power**: _power_ is the probability of detecting spreads different from 0.
